1. Setup and Initialization
    •	Graphics and Content:
  The Game1 class sets up the graphics device and loads 3D models (cube and floor).
    •	Physics Engine Initialization:
    •	BufferPool: Allocates memory for the physics simulation.
    •	Simulation: The main BepuPhysics simulation object, created with:
    •	NarrowPhaseCallbacks (collision response)
    •	PoseIntegratorCallbacks (gravity, here set to (0, -1, 0))
    •	SolveDescription (solver settings)
    •	Thread Dispatcher:
   SimpleThreadDispatcher is used to run the simulation on multiple threads for better performance.

2. Physics World Setup
    •	Static Floor:
  Adds a large static box (the floor) to the simulation at position (0, -0.5, 0) with size 20000x1x20000.
    •	Dynamic Box:
    •	Shape: A 1x1x1 box.
    •	Inertia: Calculated for a mass of 0.4f.
    •	Body:
    •	Placed at (0, 10, 0) (10 units above the floor).
    •	Oriented with a rotation of -50 degrees around the (0, 1, 1) axis.
    •	Added to the simulation as a dynamic body (affected by gravity and collisions).

3. Simulation Step (Update)
    •	Physics Step:
  Each frame, the simulation advances by 1/60th of a second using the thread dispatcher.
    •	Box Pose Update:
  The position and orientation of the box are retrieved from the simulation and used to update the _world matrix, which is used for rendering.
4. Rendering (Draw)
    •	Floor and Box Rendering:
    •	The floor is drawn at (0, -1, 0).
    •	The box is drawn using its updated world matrix, reflecting its simulated position and rotation.
    •	Default lighting is enabled for the cube.

5. Input Handling
    •	Pressing Escape or the gamepad's back button exits the game.

Summary:
    •	BepuPhysics is used to simulate a falling, rotating box on a static floor.
    •	The simulation is multithreaded for performance.
    •	The results of the simulation are visualized in real time using MonoGame.
